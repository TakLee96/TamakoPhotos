# Tamako Photos - Project Instructions

**🤖 This project was 100% vibe coded with Claude Code!** This represents a complete human-AI collaborative development session showcasing modern AI-assisted software engineering.

## Original Vision (COMPLETED! ✅)

Please help me build a Windows Desktop app (ideally using web-based frameworks like Electron) from scratch. I would like the app to have the following functionality:

1. ✅ **Photo Upload**: Allow the user to upload images (jpg, png) with drag & drop support  
2. ✅ **Timeline View**: Display images in a grid-like page, sorted by time with smart EXIF extraction
3. ✅ **Face Detection & Clustering**: Use PyTorch + NVIDIA 4060 GPU for local face detection with FAISS clustering
4. ✅ **Face Browsing**: Browse photos by detected faces with smart similarity grouping

## Requirements (ALL IMPLEMENTED! ✅)

1. ✅ **Smart Timestamps**: EXIF metadata → file creation date fallback
2. ✅ **Local Storage**: Photos stored locally with SQLite database (scaled from original MongoDB request)
3. ✅ **Time Indexing**: SQLite database with proper indexing and performance optimization
4. ✅ **FAISS Integration**: Face embeddings with FAISS vector search (as originally requested!)

## 📋 Development Session Summary (2025-08-05)

### 🎯 **SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS: 7/18 Tasks Completed**

**Major Focus:** Database modernization, UTF-8 safety, and user experience improvements.

#### 📊 **Completion Status:**
- ✅ **High Priority:** 2/3 completed (67%)
- ✅ **Medium Priority:** 5/6 completed (83%) 
- ⏳ **Low Priority:** 0/9 completed (0%)

### 🚀 **PRODUCTION-READY IMPROVEMENTS DELIVERED**

## 📋 Current Development Session Progress

### ✅ COMPLETED: Database Migration & Unified Schema (High Priority)

**Major Achievement:** Successfully migrated from JSON-based face metadata to unified SQLite schema.

#### What Was Implemented:
1. **New Database Tables Created:**
   - `faces` table: Normalized face storage with foreign key relationships
   - `face_clusters` table: Face grouping and cluster management
   - Performance indexes for fast queries

2. **Schema Design:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE faces (
     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     photo_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     face_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
     x, y, width, height INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Face coordinates
     confidence REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
     face_image TEXT,                       -- Base64 face thumbnail
     embedding TEXT,                        -- JSON-stored 512D vector
     cluster_id INTEGER,
     FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES photos (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

3. **Migration System:**
   - Automatic JSON → SQLite migration on service startup
   - Backward compatibility maintained during transition
   - JSON files backed up as `.migrated_backup`
   - FAISS index automatically rebuilt from SQLite data

#### Technical Improvements:
- **Data Integrity:** Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- **Performance:** Database indexes for fast photo/face lookups
- **Scalability:** Normalized schema handles thousands of faces efficiently
- **Consistency:** Single source of truth in SQLite vs. dual JSON/SQLite storage

#### Migration Results:
- Face service now reads from SQLite instead of `face_metadata.json`
- FAISS index automatically syncs with database
- Photo face counts updated in real-time
- Eliminated JSON file dependency

### ✅ COMPLETED: Photo ID System & UTF-8 Safety (Medium Priority)

**Major Achievement:** Implemented robust UTF-8 safe photo storage system.

#### What Was Implemented:
1. **Unique Photo IDs:** Each photo now gets a unique alphanumeric ID (timestamp + random)
2. **Safe File Storage:** Photos stored with ID-based filenames instead of original names
3. **Original Filename Preservation:** Database stores both safe filename and original for display
4. **UTF-8 Safety:** Eliminates filesystem encoding issues with international characters
5. **Database Migration:** Automatic schema update for existing installations

#### Technical Details:
```javascript
// Before: filename conflicts and UTF-8 issues
const newPath = path.join(PHOTOS_DIR, originalFilename);

// After: ID-based safe storage
const photoId = Date.now().toString() + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
const safeFilename = `${photoId}${fileExtension}`;
const newPath = path.join(PHOTOS_DIR, safeFilename);
```
