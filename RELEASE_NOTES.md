# Tamako Photos v1.0.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 What's New

**Tamako Photos** is an AI-powered photo management application built with 100% Claude Code collaboration!

### ✨ Key Features
- **🤖 Advanced Face Detection**: MTCNN + FaceNet with GPU acceleration
- **⚡ Lightning-Fast Search**: FAISS vector similarity for sub-millisecond face clustering  
- **📸 Smart Photo Management**: Drag-and-drop with automatic EXIF metadata extraction
- **📅 Timeline View**: Photos sorted by timestamp with thumbnail generation
- **👥 Face Clustering**: Automatic grouping with preserving single-face clusters
- **💾 Local Storage**: SQLite database, scalable to thousands of photos
- **🚀 Auto-Service Management**: Background ML services start automatically

### 🔧 System Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 8GB RAM
- 2GB free disk space

**Recommended:**
- 16GB+ RAM for large photo collections
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (10x performance boost)
- Python 3.8+ with conda environment named `tensorflow`

### 📦 Installation

1. **Download**: `Tamako Photos 1.0.0.exe` from this release
2. **Run**: Double-click the executable to start
3. **Python Setup** (for face detection):
   ```bash
   conda create -n tensorflow python=3.10
   conda activate tensorflow
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
   pip install faiss-cpu opencv-python pillow numpy python-multipart scikit-learn facenet-pytorch fastapi uvicorn
   ```

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Launch** the application
2. **Upload Photos**: Drag-and-drop or browse to upload JPG/PNG images
3. **Browse Timeline**: View photos sorted by date
4. **Face Detection**: Switch to "Faces" tab to see grouped faces
5. **Enjoy**: Lightning-fast photo management with AI!

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Electron with modern responsive UI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with MTCNN + FaceNet
- **Database**: SQLite for scalable photo metadata
- **ML Pipeline**: FAISS vector indexing for instant similarity search
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated PyTorch with persistent indexing

### 🎯 Performance Benchmarks

- **Face Detection**: ~0.135s per image (9 faces detected)
- **Similarity Search**: <1ms for 1000+ faces
- **Database**: Handles thousands of photos efficiently
- **Memory**: Optimized for large collections

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Face detection requires Python environment setup
- App works fully without face detection (photo management always available)
- For GPU acceleration, ensure CUDA drivers are installed

### 🔮 Coming Next

See the comprehensive TODO section in README.md for upcoming features:
- SQLite-only persistence (removing JSON files)
- Enhanced face cluster interactions
- Improved UI/UX
- Portable builds with bundled Python

### 🏆 Built with Claude Code
